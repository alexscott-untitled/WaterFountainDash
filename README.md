### Precursor — NextJS Template

This repository contains the base packages, folder structures, and configs (ESLint, Prettier, Jest) for bootstrapping a blank, (mostly) un-opinionated starting point for a new NextJS project.

### Running The Project

Prereqs to running the project include having node, npm, and yarn (1) installed on your machine. If you need help getting the project started let someone from the frontend team know and we'll get you setup. OR here are some links to installation documentation:

- [Node and npm Installation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Yarn 1 Installation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable)

After that. all you need to do to run the project is run the commands _yarn_ and _yarn dev_.
